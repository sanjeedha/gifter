Making it yours
-----------------

+ Author section
+ Tagline description


----Author section----
I have added a few little features to help you customise Green Marinée.

In the file sidebar.php I have included a section for you to briefly add a description about yourself or the site. 

To active this you will need to open sidebar.php (located in greenmarinee) with Notepad/Textedit or a html editor and locate the author section. (commented by default)

Remove the comment by deleting the <!-- at the beginning and the --> at the end. Also delete the line "Here is a section you can use to briefly talk about yourself or your site. Uncomment and delete this line to use."

Withing the paragraph tags <p> write a brief sentence about yourself. If you prefer to use this section to talk about the site change "The Author" to what ever you like.

Save your changes and upload and replace the file located on the server.

----Tagline description----
You may have noticed you site's tagline has disappeared. This is turned off by default; but don't worry here is how you can get it back.

Firstly make sure you actually do have a tagline. To check login to your WordPress admin panel and select Options from the menu. You will see either an empty box or your site's tagline next to the Tagline: section. Save the changes you made if any and logout.

On your local machine open up the file style.css (located in greenmarinee) with Notepad/Textedit or a html editor and locate both the h1 and .tagline sectors.

To use the tagline uncomment the second h1 by removing <!-- --> and the comment description. Please make sure you comment the first h1 by adding <!-- to the beginning and --> to the end.

Now scroll down to the structure area and locate .tagline. Again uncomment and remove the comment description to active.

Open up header.php (located in greenmarinee) with Notepad/Textedit or a html editor and locate <!-- Tag line description is off by default. Please see readme.txt or CSS(h1,tagline) for more info <div class="tagline"><?php // remove bloginfo('description'); ?></div> -->

Again remove the comment and description and the "// remove" from the php call. 

Save your changes and upload and replace the files located on the server.
